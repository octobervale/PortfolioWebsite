            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. Here you can find information about my projects and skills.</p>
            <p>I'm a passionate developer dedicated to creating projects that combine creativity, innovation, and a
                focus on user-centric design. With experience spanning databases, interactive tools, games, and mobile
                apps, I strive to bring ideas to life with engaging visuals and accessible solutions for everyone.

                I believe in the power of technology to enhance creativity, whether it's helping crafters stay
                organized, building immersive gaming experiences, or designing tools that streamline everyday tasks.
                Accessibility and inclusivity are at the core of my workâ€”I aim to ensure that every project is not just
                functional but also welcoming and enjoyable for all users.

                When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring new crafts, diving into various video games, or
                writing short stories.</p>
